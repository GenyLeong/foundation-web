	Copied the FAQ into these pages so we can have a nicer and
	more uniform appearance.  In the future, make sure to run
	tidy first, since this is pretty ugly.

	Updating the various pages so they have a common style and
	set of links.  Before you couldn't navigate from any of them
	to the main page or to www.gnome.org or to each other.  Now
	you can :)
