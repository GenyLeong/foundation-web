<p><b>Overview of the GNOME Foundation Board of
Directors </b>
</p>
<p><br/><br/>
</p>
<p><u><b>GNOME Foundation Overview</b></u></p>
<p>The GNOME Foundation will work to
further the goal of the GNOME project: to create a computing platform
for use by the general public that is completely free software.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, the Foundation will coordinate releases of
GNOME and determine which projects are part of GNOME. The Foundation
will act as an official voice for the GNOME project, providing a
means of communication with the press and with commercial and
noncommercial organizations interested in GNOME software. The
foundation may produce educational materials and documentation to
help the public learn about GNOME software. In addition, it may
sponsor GNOME-related technical conferences, represent GNOME at
relevant conferences sponsored by others, help create technical
standards for the project and promote the use and development of
GNOME software. For more information, see <a href="/">The
GNOME Foundation Web Site</a>.</p>
