This branch is some work that I (Greg Leblanc
<gleblanc@linuxweasel.com>) am doing in order to get
foundation.gnome.org converted to the new site look and feel.  

If you want to take a look at where things are going, grab this from
CVS, set up a documentroot and a virtualhost for this (so that
relative links work), and do 'evilsedhack < somefile.html >
/web/root/somefile.html'.  The list of files that I ran this on is in
the ChangeLog.  You'll also need to copy over the logos directory,
gnome.jpg, and text.png (at least for now, those may be gone
tomorrow).  Enjoy,
	Greg
