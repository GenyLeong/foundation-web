  <title>The GNOME Foundation: Elections</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <h1>Candidates for Fall 2002 GNOME Foundation Elections</h1>
 <!--<p>Nov 10, 2001</p>-->
 <p>
   Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the GNOME
   Foundation Board of Directors. A short summary statement from each candidate
   and a link to their full candidacy announcement is provided to help you
   learn more about them. We encourage all voters to read the full candidacy
   statements and related discussions on foundation-list@gnome.org
   (<a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/</a>).
 </p>
 <p>
   When deciding who you should vote for, please carefully consider the
   various tasks the Board of Directors must perform. This overview
   (<a href="overview.html">http://foundation.gnome.org/overview.html</a>)
   may be helpful. Keep in mind that the board will make a number of
   important decisions and will also have to perform many tasks which
   require a significant amount of time and effort and the ability to work
   and communicate with other people, companies, and the media. The board of
   directors will represent GNOME to companies and the world in a very real
   way. It is a good idea to strive for a well-balanced board consisting of
   people with various backgrounds, skills, and perspectives.
 </p>
 <p>
   Additional election details can be found at the end of this message and on

  <h2>Candidates for the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors</h2>
  <h3>1. Martin Sevior</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    Now that the push for corporate desktop is on in earnest I believe I can
    help the GNOME community of volunteer hackers feel empowered by
    providing a genuinely independent voice on the Board. I can do this
    because I have no financial stake in any company. I contribute to
    AbiWord and GNOME for the love of hacking and the desire to be part of
    the project to make the World's best desktop.

  </ul>
  
  <h3>2. Richard Stallman</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I've been working for GNOME since years before there was a GNOME.  In
    1983, while formulating plans for the GNU operating system, I decided
    it should include a window system.  After two desktop initiatives that
    didn't pan out, I found Miguel, who launched our third desktop
    project--GNOME.
  </p>
  <p>
    As president of the Free Software Foundation and Chief GNUisance of
    the GNU Project, I have had years of experience working with
    contributors both individual and corporate.

  </ul>
  
  <h3>3. Miguel de Icaza</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    Have been an active contributor to the free software movement since 1992.
  </p>
  <p>
    Started the GNOME project when various freedom issues arised that would
    threaten the future of a fully free system.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am one of the founders of Ximian, one of the GNOME companies, where we
    employ around 40 GNOME hackers that develop free software.
  </p>
  <p>
    Have been actively involved for the past year in the development of Mono
    and the Gtk bindings for C#.

  </ul>

  <h3>4. Bill Haneman</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I am active not only in the accessibility project work, but also am
    actively working with the groups doing Mozilla, OpenOffice, and Java
    integration with GNOME.  My goals for GNOME: a great developer platform,
    a complete user desktop environment that is not only free but fully
    accessible to everyone.  I am a also Sun Microsystems employee, but would
    serve as an "individual contributor" and always keep the "big picture"
    for GNOME paramount.

  <h3>5. Mike Newman</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I'm standing as an independant, experienced committee worker with the
    international and democratic interests of GNOME as my prime concerns,
    along with transparent and accessible board activity. Having been involved
    in GNOME for two years working with the membership committee, and with
    a great deal of experience in similar roles I feel I have a wide view
    of GNOME's goals and the capabilities and time to serve as an effective
    board member.

  <h3>6. Glynn Foster</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I do GNOME hacking at Sun. I don't do celery. I do motivation and energy. I
    don't do philosophy, politics or vegemite. I do random documentation. I
    don't do cucumber. I do weekly release team meetings. I don't do toilet
    cleaning. I do climbing and beer.  I don't do chewing gum. I do opinions,
    sleep and campus boards. I don't do veruccas. I do mobile phones badly. I

  <h3>7. Bastien Nocera</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I've been a GNOME developer for more than 2 years now, starting as an
    independant application developer, and finding myself more and more
    involved in work on the core desktop.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have never before been part of such a board, but I understand the
    requisites for such a position, and will do everything to represent
    the people voting for me.

  <h3>8. Malcolm Tredinnick</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    Have done a reasonable amount of API documentation, along with writing
    a few standalone documents aimed at helping developers use GNOME
    more easily. I am interested in seeing GNOME be pitched as viable
    desktop platform to developers and would like to see more events such
    as Sun's developer courses and the tutorials planned for next year's
    GUADEC. Experience serving on committees both at state and national level.

  <h3>10. Daniel Veillard</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I am French, long time Gnomer and Linux addict, maintainer of libxml,
    libxslt and rpmfind. I served on the Gnome Board for two years and
    I am used to non-profit organizations and the negociations needed to
    reach consensus in a group. I will focuse on the reuse of standards,
    internationalization and keeping trust relationship at an individual
    level. I think those are needed to keep hacking on Gnome fun and getting
    acceptance in new communities. Growing the foundation to get acceptance
    by program developpers is the next challenge of the Board.

  <h3>12. Jeff Waugh</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I am passionate about GNOME and Free Software, and have committed a large
    amount of my time and energy to helping our exceptional hackers do their
    magic. This year my primary contribution to GNOME was leadership of the
    Release Team to help our hackers pull off the amazing GNOME 2.0 release.
    I will work to build upon GNOME's contributor base, maintain our casual,
    personal community, ensure a transparently operated Foundation, and to
    promote our project and achievements aggressively.

  <h3>13. Jim Gettys</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I'm announcing myself as a candidate for the 2002 elections of the GNOME
    Foundation board of directors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The largest value I bring to Gnome is one of perspective to the operation
    of a number of different styles of organizations. Specifically, GNOME
    needs to continue to be open to contributions of all sorts, whether code,
    or translations, or web work, to UI design and graphics, to name a few.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I don't currently write Gnome code itself, I do hack on the X Window
    System, as I have for a long time; most recently on the RandR extension.
    I've been on the Gnome board the last two years.

  </ul>

  <h3>14. Leslie Proctor</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I'd like to more closely tie GNOME marketing with the Foundation Board,
    and being part of the board will be a good way to accomplish that goal.

  </ul>

  <h3>15. Nat Friedman</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    To date, the GNOME foundation has failed to be of any substantial benefit
    to the GNOME project.  We are, however, reaching a level of momentum and
    organization at which the foundation can have a big impact.  What we
    lack is resources: funds to subsidize in-person events, to fly people
    to conferences, to support our hardware and infrastructural needs, to
    promote the project, and to provide equipment to hackers who need it.
    I served as co-chair of the board this last year and organized the
    90-person Boston GNOME Summit in July.  If elected this year, my focus
    will be on ensuring that GNOME has the resources it needs to succeed.

  &quot;
    I started working on GNOME in 1997, and have been actively a part of it
    since.  I initially wrote the AisleRiot solitaire program which appeared in
    GNOME 0.13.  Since then, I've worked on several GNOME projects including
    GTK+, control-center, gmc, nautilus, gnome-libs, and most importantly,
    gfloppy.  I also do a number of sysadmin tasks, and help with the running
    of the gnome.org boxes.  I am a current member of the board.

  <h3>18. Tim Ney</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    GNOME Foundation needs the combined efforts of hackers and non-hackers.
    Since I first worked with GNOME four years ago, getting machines and
    setting up booths and presentations, the developer community and user
    base has grown tremendously.  
  </p>
  <p>
    My contribution is to build bridges and obtain resources needed for
    GNOME to successfully continue its growth. Working with the GNOME
    community is a great experience and I'd like to continue pushing for
    more adoption by governments and schools.

  <h3>19. Luis Villa</h3>

  &quot;
    I want to get involved with the board for three reasons. First, to
    improve communications between the board and <i>all</i> volunteers,
    including, but not just, hackers. Second, to increase the board's
    activity level in areas where the board is GNOME's most effective organ,
    like marketing, infrastructure, and fundraising. Finally, to ensure that
    the board does not interfere with more direct community leadership in
    areas where that leadership is already providing effective guidance.

    I, Amy Kahn, am running for election for the Gnome Foundation Board on
    the following platform:
  </p>
  <p>
    I intend to establish better and more accessible usability standards
    in for the future of the GNOME desktop and related applications. I plan
    to do this by using my experience and expertise in the usability field,
    researching the way users do their jobs and providing that data to the
    hacker community, providing a forum for usability gurus and hackers to
    communicate, and helping said persons to organize themselves so a real
    review process can happen.

  <h3>21. Martin Baulig</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I've been hacking on GNOME almost since its early beginnings.  However,
    about a year ago I took a longer break to concentrate more on university.
  </p>
  <p>
    This spring, I became a Mono hacker and since then, I've been hacking on
    the compiler and the new Mono Debugger.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an European guy and Mono hacker, my main focus is helping GNOME
    moving forward in Europe and integrating GNOME and Mono nicely so that
    people can quickly and easily design their coolest GNOME apps with Mono.

  <h3>22. Sri Ramkrishna</h3>
  <p>
  &quot;
    I'm running for the GNOME Foundation board in order to help GNOME and in
    the process better myself by making GNOME problems, my problems.
    While I'm not a serious coder I can code; I think my talents really lie in
    facilitating and attacking problems from a high level.  I would like to
    help the GNOME project grow further by encouraging the use of GEP, help
    get documentation complete, and establish more desktop standards.  I've
    had experience in leading a diverse engineering team, worked on projects
    that spanned many physical locations, and had some management experience.
    All of which requires critical thinking and planning.  Thanks.

    We lack complete developer's documentation for our 2.0 platform.  The

    want to work with the different developers of GNOME libraries to ensure
    that their code has proper documentation.  Also, I want to help in
    coordination between the GNOME and OpenOffice.org teams --- OO.o needs
    to integrate well into the GNOME environment, and they may also be able
    to use some of our cool technologies to avoid duplicated work.
