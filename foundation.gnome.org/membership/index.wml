   <h1>GNOME Foundation Membership</h1>
   <p>
     The Membership consists of all GNOME contributors who wish to become part
     of the Membership and go through the application process.  Members can
     run for election to the Board of Directors, vote in the elections for
     the Board of Directors, and suggest referenda. The membership process is 
     overseen by the Membership and Elections Committee, which can be reached at 
     <a href="mailto:membership-commitee@gnome.org">membership-committee@gnome.org</a>.
