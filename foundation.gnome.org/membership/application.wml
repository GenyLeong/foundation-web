      To apply for membership in the GNOME Foundation, please complete the
      following form as completely as possible. Your application will then be
      reviewed by the Foundation's Membership and Elections Committee, which
      will notify you when your application has been accepted or rejected; the
      committee may also ask you for additional information. For details on the
      standards used in evaluating applications, see the <a
      href="index.html">GNOME Foundation membership policy</a>, adopted by the
      Board of Directors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Please consider reading <a href="http://live.gnome.org/MembershipCommittee/ApplicationTips">Application Tips</a> page so as to get informed about what kind of information is helpful to make your application processed faster. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have applied, you will get a ticket number per email and 
      you can see the status of your application at <a 
      href="http://www.gnome.org/rt3-stats/membership.html">the stats page</a>.
      If you have any questions regarding the application process, please feel
      free to e-mail the Committee at <a
      href="mailto:membership-committee&#64;gnome&#46;org">membership-committee&#64;gnome&#46;org</a>.

    <h3>Note about privacy</h3>

    <p>
      The GNOME Foundation tries to be as transparent as possible. This
      includes making it easy to find out who is a member of the Foundation
      and why an application is accepted or denied.
      Thus, all the information you will submit through this form will be
      publically available: the form will send an e-mail to a mailing list
      whose archives are publically available on the Internet and your
      application will be accessible through mail archives.
    </p>

      <p>
        If you are an existing Foundation member and would like to renew your application,
        check out the <b>"Previous GNOME Foundation member"</b> flag down here.
        Please also remember to fill out the full form even if you are renewing your application.

      <p>
        Please provide a detailed description of all your past and present 
        contributions to help the Membership Committee determine your
        eligibility to join the Foundation. Remember that any contribution made
        for the GNOME Foundation is valid, so either if you package GNOME software
        for a certain distribution (like Debian, Ubuntu or Fedora), translate, develop,
        write documentation or simply sponsor GNOME through talks and conferences, 
        you will be definitely welcome to join the GNOME Foundation.

        the Membership Committee the best way to verify your contributions. You should provide their
        name, a valid e-mail address to contact them, and a brief description of their role as 
        a reference. <b>Remember that two contacts are mandatory for an application to be accepted.</b>
