      To apply for membership in the GNOME Foundation, please complete the
      following form as completely as possible. Your application will then be
      reviewed by the Foundation's Membership and Elections Committee, which
      will notify you when your application has been accepted or rejected; the
      committee may also ask you for additional information. For details on the
      standards used in evaluating applications, see the <a
      href="index.html">GNOME Foundation membership policy</a>, adopted by the
      Board of Directors.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have any questions regarding the application process, please feel
      free to e-mail the committee at <a
      href="mailto:membership@gnome.org">membership@gnome.org</a>.

      <h3>GNOME Contributions</h3>

      <p>
        Membership in the GNOME Foundation requires that the candidate has
        contributed to a non-trivial improvement in the GNOME Project. Please
        use the following sections to explain how you have contributed to the
        project, providing enough detail to allow the committee to verify your
        application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please provide a short list of areas of GNOME to which you have made a
        non-trivial contribution (for entry into the public membership list).
        For example, "Documentation, gnomecal, Debian packaging.":
      </p>

      <textarea name="summary" rows="3" cols="50"><?php if ($summary) { echo $summary; } ?></textarea>

      <p>
        Please provide a more detailed description of your contributions to
        help the membership committee determine your eligibility. In general,
        anything listed above should be explained here, and additional
        contributions can be included. For example: "Wrote a chapter "How to
        Use the GNOME Calendaring System" for the GNOME Users Guide. Several
        patches for gnomecal related to color support. Packaged the 1.4 release
        for Debian.":
      </p>

      <textarea name="details" rows="10" cols="50"><?php if ($details) { echo $details; } ?></textarea>

      <p>
        Please list individuals (frequently, but not necessarily, project
        maintainers) who can help the membership committee determine your
        eligibility. You should provide their name, e-mail address, and a brief
        description of their role as a reference. If there is nobody you can
        think to list, feel free to suggest another way for the committee to
        verify your contributions, such as a pointer to a project ChangeLog,
        etc. To continue the earlier example: "Dan Mueth (d-mueth@uchicago.edu)
        (GDP coordinator); Russell Steinthal (rms39@columbia.edu) (gnome-pim
        maintainer); packaging logs at http://www.debian.org/packages/gnome/":
      </p>

      <textarea name="contacts" rows="5" cols="50"><?php if ($contacts) { echo $contacts; } ?></textarea>

      <h3>Other Comments</h3>

      <p>
        Please feel free to include any additional information which you
        believe the committee should consider while reviewing your application:
      </p>

      <textarea name="comments" rows="10" cols="50"><?php if ($comments) { echo $comments; } ?></textarea>

      <p>
        <div class="center">
          <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit Application" />
          <input type="reset" />
