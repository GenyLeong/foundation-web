    <h1>About The GNOME Foundation</h1>

    <p>
      The GNOME Foundation is comprised of a number of bodies - the 
      Board of Directors, the Executive Director, the Advisory Board 
      and the GNOME Membership. The <a href="charter/">GNOME Foundation
      Charter</a> outlines the overall purpose, structure, and process
      for the GNOME Foundation. The <a href="bylaws.pdf">GNOME Foundation By-laws</a> 
      (PDF) document the policies and procedures of the Foundation as a
      non-profit group.
    </p>

    <h2>Board of Directors</h2>

    <p>
      The GNOME Foundation is run by a Board of Directors, which is elected
      annually by the GNOME community, as the GNOME Membership, to carry out
      much of the GNOME Foundation's tasks. The Board of Directors meets every
      other week with a phone conference to discuss various topics pertaining 
      to the regular activities of the GNOME Foundation and GNOME. The minutes 
      to these meetings are posted publicly on the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/">
      foundation-list archives</a>.
    </p>
