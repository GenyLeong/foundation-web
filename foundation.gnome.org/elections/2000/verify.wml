<h1>2000 Election Verification</h1>

<p>To run the vote counting scripts, you need to perform several
steps:</p>

<p>First, obtain copies of the <a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/vote/2000-November.txt.gz">ballot
archive</a> (referred to below as 2000-November.txt), the <a
href="registered-voters.txt">membership list</a>
(registered-voters.txt), and the two voting scripts, <a
href="list-addresses.py">list-addresses.py</a> and <a
href="vote-counter.py">vote-counter.py</a></p>

<p>Then, extract the valid voting addresses from the membership list:

<pre>$ python list-addresses.py registered-voters.txt &gt; addresses.txt</pre>

<p>Next, run the vote counter script; it's probably best to save the results to a file (they are long):

<pre>$ python vote-counter.py 2000-November.txt 
&lt;cookie&gt; addresses.txt &gt; results.txt</pre>

<p>(The cookie has been lost.)</p>

<p>The results should be in results.txt.  A list of errors will be
generated at the top of the output, but note that many of those errors
will represent problems which are fixed later in the archive
(manifested by the voter having a counted ballot later in the
results).  The final tallies will be at the bottom.</p>

<p>To exactly replicate the posted results, you should apply this <a
href="vote-archives.diff">diff file</a>, which represents the
votetakers' changes to the voting archive to fix malformatted ballots to
reflect the evident intent of the voters.</p>
