      <h1>GNOME Foundation Election Rules &amp; Timeline</h1>


       <h2>Election Rules</h2> 

       <ol>
	<li>
	  See the <a href="../../documentation/charter.html">GNOME Foundation charter</a> for general rules.
	</li>

	<li>
	  There are 11 board slots that are to be filled during this election.</li>

	<li>
	  Members of the GNOME Foundation as of November 1, 2002 are eligible to 
	  vote in the election.  Anyone who has made a contribution to GNOME can 
	  apply for membership by completing the <a href="../../membership/application.php">application</a>.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Any eligible voter is eligible to be elected to the Board of Directors.  
	  To announce your candidacy, send a message to foundation-announce@gnome.org 
	  with your full name, e-mail, corporate affiliation (if any), and a description 
	  of your reasons for wanting to serve as a director.  Candidacies must be 
	  announced prior to November 4, 2002, 23:59 UTC.
	</li>

	<li>
	  All candidates should mail a summary of their candicacy announcement (see 
	  previous rule) to elections@gnome.org.  Summaries should be no more than 75 
	  words of continuous text (i.e. no bullet lists or multiple paragraphs) and 
	  must be received by the nomination deadline given above.  A compilation of the 
	  summaries will be mailed to all registered voters several days prior to the 
	  election.
	</li>

	<li>
	  All discussion related to the election should be held on foundation-list@gnome.org.  Members 
	  are invited to ask questions to one or all candidates on that list.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Ballots will be sent via e-mail to all eligible voters on November 25, 2002, and must 
	  be returned by December 2, 2002, 23:59 UTC (18:59 EST).  Full instructions will be 
	  included in the ballot.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Ballots will be held confidential during the election, but an archive of all submitted 
	  ballots will be made publicly accessible at its conclusion.
	</li>

	<li>
	  The Elections Committee is responsible for counting the ballots, after taking appropriate
	  action to fix misformatted ballots.
	</li> 
	
	<li>
	  The 11 candidates who receive the most votes will be elected, except that no more than 
	  four individuals affiliated with any one corporation may be elected.  Should more than 
	  four of the top eleven vote-getters be affiliated with the same company, only the four 
	  with the most votes will be considered elected.  For a full definition of corporate 
	  affiliation, see the GNOME Foundation Charter.
	</li>

	<li>
	  In the event of a tie for the final slot on the board, the Elections Committee will schedule a 
	  run-off election as soon as possible.
	</li> 

	<li>
	  The Elections Committee will announce preliminary results as soon as possible after the election 
	  closes, along with instructions on how to access the ballot archive and how to independently 
	  verify the vote count.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Any eligible voter may challenge the preliminary results by e-mailing elections@gnome.org prior 
	  to December 20, 2002.  The decision of the Elections Committee as to any challenge shall be 
	  final.  Once any challenges have been resolved, the Elections Committee shall announce the final 
	  results.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Any questions regarding these procedures should be directed to the Elections Committee by e-mail 
	  to elections@gnome.org.  The committee shall have the power to make any necessary changes or 
	  clarifications to these rules at any point during the election.
