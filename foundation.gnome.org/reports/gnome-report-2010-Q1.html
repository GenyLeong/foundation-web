    <h1>Board of Directors</h1>
        <h2>Brian Cameron</h2>

    <div class="columns">
<p>First of all, the GNOME Foundation board of directors would like to express a huge thank you to all the volunteers who help to make the GNOME community possible, and to all those who use the GNOME desktop and understand the value of free software on the desktop. It is you that makes the GNOME community both rich and rewarding.</p>

<p>In Q1, the GNOME community has gone through some significant
organizational changes.  Lucas Rocha stepped down from the board to
spend more time with his family and new baby and Behdad Esfahbod
stepped down because other interests were consuming too much of his
time.  Jorge Castro and Paul Cutler have stepped up to replace Lucas
and Behdad.  A warm welcome to the new board members and the board
wishes to thank both Lucas and Behdad for the years of dedicated
service towards the GNOME community.  We wish Lucas the best with his
family and Behdad with his future endeavors.  Also, Willie Walker is
stepping down as the GNOME accessibility team lead.  The board would
like to thank Willie for all of his dedicated help over the years and
wishes him the best for the future.</p>

<p>On March 31, the board was excited to announce the successful release
of GNOME 2.30, the latest stable release of the popular Free Software
desktop environment and applications suite.  The next release will be
the highly anticipated GNOME 3 release.  The board is working hard to
ensure it will be a success.</p>

<p>Much energy in Q1 has been focused on planning for the GUADEC 2010
event which will be held in The Hague, Netherlands from July 26-30.
The GUADEC 2010 website is looking handsome and is now live at
http://www.guadec.org/.  Planning is going smoothly and the talk
schedule will soon be made public.  GUADEC organizers have made a call
for volunteers on February 1st, so please consider volunteering to help
if you can.</p>

<p>The board reached an agreement to have a training session at GUADEC
which will be run by Neary Consulting.  The fee will be approximately
???1,500 per person.  The training session will consists of full two-day
sessions before the event covering the following topics:

<ol>
<li>Development tools, including source control, profiling, IDE
  integration, and maybe a word on mobile development
  environments;</li>
<li>Overview of the GNOME Platform;</li>
<li>Best technical practices for GNOME development - a practical
  half-day development workshop where people have an assignment to
  accomplish; and</li>
<li>Social issues of free software development - working with the
  upstream community, using community mailing lists effectively,
  evaluating risks associated with community governance, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>

<p>This will be a joint-venture, where the GNOME Foundation will earn 40%
and Neary Consulting will earn 60% of the revenues.  Neary Consulting
will be in charge of contracting teachers, preparing the training
material, marketing, etc. and GNOME Foundation will provide branding,
support, and quality control.   The training materials will be released
with a free license.
</p>

<p>The board has also been working hard to organize relevant hackfests to
prepare and plan for the GNOME 3 release.  In Q1 the GNOME Foundation
helped to organize The GNOME Usability Hackfest in London (February
22-26), the Desktop Help Hackfest in Chicago (March 20-21), and the
Accessibility Hackfest at the CSUN conference in San Diego (March
23-27).</p>

<div class="columns">

<p>In Q1, the GNOME community has been working to improve infrastructure
and has made progress with adopting a new CRM system, though more work
is needed.  The Foundation is now conducting regular public IRC meetings
to encourage more community involvement in GNOME Foundation business.
The new Friends of GNOME donation ruler was successfully launched and
has made a significant impact towards improving fundraising towards
hiring a GNOME system administrator.</p>

<p>In February, the GNOME Foundation received a substantial $10,000
(US$) donation from the Mozilla Corporation to benefit GNOME
accessibility.  The board would like to thank the Mozilla Corporation
for promoting this humanitarian project and we are excited to have the
resources to further promote software that breaks barriers that would
otherwise prevent people from being able to make use of free desktop
software.</p>

<p>On March 16th, the GNOME Foundation and KDE e.V. boards decided to
co-locate their flagship conferences once again in 2011, and are now
taking bids to host the combined event.  This follows on the
successful 2009 Gran Canaria Desktop Summit and will again provide
both communities with the opportunity for both communities to
share talks, work together to improve free desktop software, and
socialize.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the next quarter, the board anticipates that a
significant amount of energy will be spent planning for GUADEC and
helping to ensure the success of GNOME 3 which is planned for release
in September.  The board is continuing to plan hackfests for the next
quarter including a GSettings hackfest in Boston, USA (April 12-17),
a Python Bindings hackfest in Boston, USA (April 14-18), and another
Marketing hackfest in Zaragoza, Spain (May 5-7).  To further outreach
to developing nations, the GNOME community is planning to have a
presence at FOSS Nigeria in Kano, Nigeria (April 23-25) and the
Idlelo open source event in Accra, Ghana (May 17-21).</p>

<p>Please consider becoming a Friend of GNOME.  Your donations really do
help the GNOME Foundation continue to grow and provide support and
services for the success of the GNOME project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gnome.org/friends/">http://www.gnome.org/friends/</a></p>
<p>The board is always looking for people willing to help with different
tasks.  If you are interested, we encourage you to get in touch with the
GNOME board of directors (board@gnome.org) to discuss the best way for
you to get involved.</p>

    <h1>Release Team</h1>
    <h2>Vincent Untz</h2>
    
    <div class="columns">
  <p>The main focus in the beginning of 2010 was the final sprint towards the last major release of the GNOME 2.x cycle. With two development releases, two beta releases, one release candidate, the start of all the usual freezes and a good number of freeze break requests, the three months of Q1 illustrated well the broad work accomplished by the whole community for GNOME 2.30.0. This effort lead to the successful release of 2.30.0 on March 29th. The release notes highlight some of the new features or good improvements in this release: sending files easily to contacts, improved file management, better experience for instant messaging, dbus-based gnome-keyring (using a protocol that will be shared with KDE), etc.</p>

<p>Obviously, the release team did not just work on getting GNOME 2.30.0 out, but also laid some foundations for the next cycle. As a first step, an initial draft of the 2.31/3.0 development cycle was published, and after some adjustments, got announced. Continuing our long-standing tradition of six-months release cycles, GNOME 3.0.0 will be out on September 29th.</p>

<p>The period for new module proposals opened in February, with some initial discussion from the community. This instance is obviously a bit different compared to previous module proposal periods since the next release is GNOME 3.0 and the new modules will receive even more spotlight than usual. The proposed modules include the expected clutter and gnome-shell, as well as various applications: deja-dup (a backup tool), mousetrap (an accessibility tool to control the mouse cursor), pdfmod (an application to modify PDF files), rygel (a collection of DLNA services) and simple-scan (a scanning tool). Other modules might still get proposed as the period for module proposals closes at the beginning of May.</p>

<p>An important area the release team wanted to explore for 3.0 is the reorganization of the modulesets. As of today, we have the Platform, the Desktop, the Bindings, the Administrator Suite and the Developer Tools. This model has served us well and has actually evolved with time (we didn't have the Administrator Suite and the Developer Tools at first). However, we feel that this organization is reaching its limits, and we have explored several potential changes. A sample of issues illustrate the need for an evolution here. First, the arbitrary separation between the Platform and the Bindings can lead people to think that the bindings are second-class citizen while this is certainly not the case. Another issue that we want to address is that the Desktop set has expanded so much that it's now unclear which type of application should go in and which shouldn't; it's also forcing us to choose one application over another, or to avoid this choice, like in the famous Rhythmbox vs Banshee case. Moreover, we strongly believe that we should encourage a strong ecosystem of applications around GNOME, and integrating all applications in the GNOME Desktop moduleset is not the best way to achieve this.</p>

<p>In the next quarter, GNOME will release two 2.30 stable releases, effectively marking the end of the 2.x cycle. Of course, most of the community is already heavily involved in the 2.31 development cycle that will lead to GNOME 3.0 a few months after GUADEC!

    <h1>Marketing Team</h1>
    <h2>Paul Cutler</h2>
    
    <div class="columns">
        <p>The Marketing team has been busy brainstorming GNOME 3.0 marketing
activities which will be worked on at the upcoming Marketing Hackfest in
Zaragoza, Spain the first week of May.  Discussion has centered around
answering the question "What is GNOME 3.0" including the impact of GNOME
Shell, new and updated applications on the GNOME Desktop and potential promotional
videos to show users the changes.</p>

<p>In addition to GNOME 3.0 planning the GNOME Press Team welcomed a new
team lead in Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier, Andreas Nilsson was instrumental
in launching the new GNOME store at http://www.zazzle.com/gnome, Lucas
Rocha and Andreas Nilsson helped with the Sysadmin fundraising campaign
and the ruler on various GNOME websites and the new gnome.org website
saw a number of content updates as it gets closer to launching later
this year.</p>

<p>Lastly, GNOME Journal saw two issues released in the first quarter.
Issue 18 was a special edition focused on Multimedia with reviews of
PiTiVi and Banshee, an interiew with Jonathan Thomas, creator of
OpenShot and an article focusing on writing multimedia applications with
Vala.  Issue 19 released in late March featured an interview with Juan
Jos?? S??nchez Penas of the GNOME Advisory Board, opportunistic
development, an overview of Mallard, an article about the GNOME Miro
Community and a case study on the recent GNOME Bugzilla upgrade.

    <div class="columns">
        <p>The main focus for the usability team this quarter has been organising, attending, and working on tasks arising from the week-long GNOME User Experience Hackfest that was held in London in February. The hackfest was sponsored by Canonical, Google, and the GNOME Foundation, with Canonical's London office also being the venue.</p>

<p>It was one of the largest GNOME hackfests ever organised, with around 30 attendees over the week.  As such, many topics were covered, including:
<ul>
<li>ongoing design and development of gnome-shell for GNOME 3.0
</li>
<li>brainstorming of nautilus file manager improvements
</li>
<li>planning updates to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines
</li>
<li>discussion of control center enhancements (including card sorting sessions with external participants)
</li>
<li>a new icon style for GNOME 3.0
</li>
<li>improving designer and developer awareness of accessibility issues
</li>
<li>how best to present usability findings to developers
</li>
<li>improving communication and workflow between GNOME designers working in different locations and companies
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Thanks to M??ir??n Duffy from Red Hat, and Robby Clements and Josh Adams from Isotope 11, the latter of these discussions has spawned a new project called Design Hub: <a href="http://live.gnome.org/UsabilityProject/Whiteboard/DesignHub">http://live.gnome.org/UsabilityProject/Whiteboard/DesignHub</a>

    <h1>Accessibility Team</h1>
    <h2>Bryen Yunashko</h2>
    
    <div class="columns">
        <p>The GNOME Accessibility (A11y) team has had a number of developments in the past quarter.  The biggest event was when many of us travelled to San Diego in March of 2010 to participate in the first ever GNOME A11y Hackfest and to man GNOME Foundation's booth at the CSUN Accessibility Technology conference.  This was organized by Eitan Isaacson and made possible through the generous grant from the Mozilla Foundation.  Many of the Hackfest sessions were led by Willie Walker.</p>

<p>The Hackfest largely focused on team organization and priorities for the upcoming GNOME 3.0  release.  And the conference booth exposed many people unfamiliar with FOSS to the benefits of using a GNOME desktop for their accessibility needs.</p>

<p>Individually, we've seen contribution and development continue to grow.
<ul>
<li>MouseTrap ??? Useability improvements have been made and joystick mode was restored.  Focus on translattion from python to C++ for better performance.  This effort was led by Flavio Percoli
</li>
<li>Caribou -  Continues to receive excellent contributions from the community.  Ben Konrath and Steve Lee joined forces on a hackfest competition between UCLA and USC universities to improve Caribou.  This contest was sponsored by Project Possibility.
</li>
<li>WebKitGTK+ Accessibility ??? Strides in accessibility continue with the contributions from Joanmarie Diggs, Xan Lopez, and interns from Igalia.
</li>
<li>Orca ??? Bug fixes continue to be implemented and towards the end of the quarter, Joanmarie Diggs assumed maintainership role for the Orca community.
</li>
<li>Outreach ??? Bryen Yunashko took on the task of forming an GNOME A11y Outreach initiative to spread the word about the benefits of GNOME Accessibility and bring more user adoption and avenues for contributions to a11y development.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For the next quarter, the team intends to focus primarily on accessibility for GNOME 3.0/GNOME Shell as well as working with projects like Project Possibility, HFOSS.org, and others to form strong partnership with students developing their skills around accessibility technology.</p>

<p>There is great concern about the accessibilty of GNOME 3.0, and folks like Joseph Scheuhammer and Alejandro Pi??eiro continue to give it their attention.  The roadmap for GNOME Shell accessibility can be found at <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/RoadmapTwoThirtyOne#Accessibility">http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/RoadmapTwoThirtyOne#Accessibility</a></p>

    <h1>Documentation Team</h1>
    <h2>Shaun McCance</h2>
    
    <div class="columns">
        <p>In the first quarter of 2010, the documentation team
completed four Mallard documents for the GNOME 2.30
desktop. They began planning on other help documents,
and helped plan and write help for applications not
in the official GNOME release.</p>

<p>Shaun hosted the Desktop Help Summit, a small gathering
of key documentation people from GNOME, KDE, XFCE, Fedora,
and Ubuntu. The Summit helped us understand what problems
distributors are having, and how we provide documentation
that better reflects what our users actually use.</p>

<p>At the Summit, Shaun and Richard Johnson (KDE) created a
proposal for a common place to install documentation and
a standard way to reference it. This will help third-party
developers integrate with the desktop, and it will help
distributors create and manage common documentation.</p>

<p>After the Summit, Shaun, Phil, and Milo had a planning
session for the new Mallard-based help for 3.0. They
focused on Internet connectivity and file management.</p>

<p>Phil has been talking with the Ubuntu team about using
Mallard, and how GNOME's use of Mallard affects Ubuntu.
The Ubuntu documentation team seems largely positive.
There are some concerns which are being discussed and
handled by the community..</p>

details on the a11y hackfest can be found at <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Accessibility/Hackfest2010">http://live.gnome.org/Accessibility/Hackfest2010</a>.</p>


<p>The hackfest organizers have done a great job of aggregating all the
blogs. You could read on all the developments at

<p>The Travel Committee started Q1 with a goal to clear off all the pending
reimbursements, and by the first week of April we did achieve it. We
reviewed all the previous applications, collected the invoices from all
the sponsored contributors and had them reimbursed within a week. This
closes the chapter for 2009. The Travel Committee also made its
announcement of accepting sponsorship requests for GUADEC 2010.</p>

    <h1>Women Outreach</h1>
        <h2>Marina Zhurakhinskaya</h2>

    <div class="columns">
<p>Several women from GNOME participated in a very successful track on women in free software at the LibrePlanet conference hosted by FSF on March 19-21 in Cambridge, MA. It was a great opportunity to meet women from other free software projects and discuss the strategies for recruiting and retaining women in free software. In addition,  M??ir??n Duffy made a presentation about GIMP and Inkscape and Marina Zhurakhinskaya made a presentation about GNOME Shell.</p>

<p>We have encouraged women to apply for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) with GNOME this year by e-mailing the GNOME women mailing list, spreading the word on Facebook, identi.ca, and Twitter, and e-mailing the individual women who got in touch with us through the outreach program. In the end, there were five women applicants for GSoC with GNOME this year - two of them originally got in touch with us through the outreach program and three applied on their own. We guided all of them through the application process, matched them up with projects and mentors, and provided application feedback. The selection process is still underway.</p>

<p>In the next quarter we look forward to supporting the selected GSoC participant(s). We'll keep up our efforts to encourage women participation in GNOME by making it more obvious that the mentors participating in the Outreach Program for Women are happy to help women get started with the projects any time throughout the year and following up with interested women.</p>

    <h1>Art Team</h1>

    <div class="columns">
<p>The Art Team has been quite active this quarter.</p>

<p>Lapo Calamandrei and Jakub Steiner delivered the finishing touches of GNOME's new icon theme, which has been under development for a couple of years now. It is great that we can finally see this work released in GNOME 2.30. With that comes a whole new set of high resolution icons. A lot of icon improvements have also been contributed by the broader community.</p>

<p>Vinicius Depizzol has been doing a lot beautiful design work for the new GNOME and GUADEC websites.</p>

<p>At the User Experience Hackfest, Garrett LeSage, Jakub Steiner and Hylke Bons made the first steps towards a new visual style and theme for GNOME 3.0 and gnome-shell, including a symbolic icon set. Thomas Wood and Benjamin Berg started creating the technical foundations needed to make these designs a reality.</p>

<p>Andreas Nilsson released a banner for GNOME 2.30 and did the new GNOME Store website layout, <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/gnome">http://www.zazzle.com/gnome</a>.</p>

<p>The Art Team also did the Sys Admin Fundraising Campaign ruler and the Thank You banner.</p>

<p>In addition to that the Art Team has been working on refreshing old assets that are scattered across the desktop.</p>
