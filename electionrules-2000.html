<p><u>Election Rules</u></p>
<ol>
	<li><p>See the <a href="charter.html">GNOME
	Foundation charter</a> for general rules.</p></li>
	<li><p>There are 11 board slots that are
	to be filled during this election.</p></li>
	<li><p>Elections are for registered
	voters (future members of the GNOME Foundation) only. Anyone who has
	made a contribution to GNOME can register. You may do so by sending
	email to <a href="mailto:membership-committee@gnome.org">membership-committee@gnome.org</a>.
	People with CVS accounts can add themselves to membership.txt in the
	Gnome-Foundation module. People who register to vote will
	automatically become members of the yet-to-be-incorporated GNOME
	Foundation, although anyone can withdraw their membership at any
	time. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>An election committee consisting
	of Dan Mueth, Martin Baulig, Russell Steinthal, Chris DiBona and
	Sergey Panov is in charge of reviewing registration/membership
	requests and will monitor the membership list for abuse, in
	accordance with the charter.</p></li>
	<li><p>To be on the ballot, anyone who is
	a member can announce their candidacy, in accordance with the
	timeline below, by sending mail to <a href="mailto:foundation-announce@gnome.org">foundation-announce@gnome.org</a>,
	including their name, e-mail address, contributions to GNOME, and
	why they want to be on the board of directors. Candidacies will be
	cross-posted on <a href="mailto:foundation-list@gnome.org">foundation-list@gnome.org</a>,
	where they can be discussed.</p></li>
	<li><p>Ballots will be sent via e-mail to
	all members. To vote, members return ballots, selecting up to 11
	candidates who will receive their vote.  Members may not vote more
	than once for the same candidate.</p></li>
	<li><p>The 11 candidates who receive the
	most votes will be elected.</p></li>
	<li><p>Not more than 4 slots may be
	occupied by individuals affiliated with any one company. See charter
	for definition of affiliation and process for enforcing this rule.</p></li>
	<li><p>If there is a tie for the 11th
	slot, the candidates who are tied may choose to let the already
	elected board members resolve the tie, or, at the request of any of
	the tied candidates, run-off elections to resolve the tie may be
	held.</p></li>
	<li><p>Votes shall be e-mailed to a
	publicly archived mailing list. The archive shall be made publicly
	accessible at the conclusion of the elections.</p></li>
	<li><p>The votes will be tallied
	automatically, with the election committee stepping in to decide on
	misformatted returns. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Foundation-list is the mailing
	list to discuss election-related issues. The election committee will
	resolve election-related disputes that are not readily resolved on
	the list.</p></li>
	<li><p>The election committee will
	announce the results of the elections.</p></li>
	<li><p>Summary Statements: All candidates
	should submit 75-word max summaries of their candidacy statement for
	inclusion in the ballot information sheet that will be posted on
	10/25. The deadline for this is Tuesday 10/24, noon pacific time.
	Candidates should also state their corporate affilitions. Statements
	that are longer than 75 words will be edited down by the elections
	committee. Summary statements should be continuous text: bullet
	lists etc. will be converted to continuous text. For candidates who
	do not submit a summary statement, the elections committee will use
	a snippet from their full candidacy statement instead. If we do not
	receive a sufficient number of these summary statements, the
	elections committee reserves the right to post these summaries
	elsewhere.</p></li>
