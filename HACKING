Please do not commit to this module without first approving changes
with the GNOME Foundation Membership Committee <membership@gnome.org>.

Note that many of these files were originally created with various
HTML authoring tools and have a lot of evil cruft in them.  It is very
unlikely that any of these files are valid HTML.  Over time we should
gradually clean them up whenever we edit them until some day all the
old cruft is gone and we have valid HTML :)

Please edit these files by hand and consider using indentation ;)
